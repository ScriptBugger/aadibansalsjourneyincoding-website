      <h2 id= "About Me">Early Days</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In my early days, when I was about 11-12, my friend said that he was a hacker. I didn't really believe him to begin with. After he started babbling on about proxy chaining and IP addresses, I finally gave up. He had clearly known his stuff.<br>Not long after, he had offered me to be taught by him on how to "hack". He didn't really teach me much, since i was on MacOS and he was doing it on windows, so our terminals/CMD prompts were in different coding languages, but we didn't let that stop us. There was a place that had opened up near my place called <em>Code Ninjas</em>. I had begged my parents to let me enroll, and soon enough, I was in. They had taught me game development and the fundamental principles of coding.<br>This was a <strong>HUGE</strong> moment, when I had finished coding my first game, without any help.<br>I had introduced my friends at school to coding, and we started a coding group called <em>BlackTreeStudios</em> (not to mention I was still only 11 at the time). We had made many games in a very short amount of time using the code editor, <em>Microsoft Makecode Arcade</em>. We had made so many games, and we wanted them to be public. We had made a website for all our games to be kept (link will be near the title of this webpage). That was our first big step for the group, and for My Life in Coding.</p>

      <h2>Minecraft DataPacks</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In lots of my pastimes, I would code Minecraft data packs. Now, these were different than actually making a mod. In data packs, you would manipulate things already in the game to make things cooler, whereas in modding, you add entirely new things and mechanics. I would make these data packs for friends to make the game more interesting and sometimes, just for fun. Some were to make the game confusing, and some were to make the user overpowered before they could even mine stone!</p>

      <h2>Testing Games</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I will be showcasing some of my newest games here for you guys to try out! Not all of them will be my new ones, and I won't be posting all of them here (you can check out the <em>BlackTreeStudios</em> website to try them all) but you can get a sort of spoiler for my upcoming games.</p>
